        <h2>Announcing the First Underhanded Rust Contest</h2>
        <h3>The Rust Programming Language Blog - December 15, 2016</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://community.rs">Rust Community Team</a> is pleased to announce the
first annual Underhanded Rust Contest, inspired by the <a href="http://www.underhanded-c.org/">Underhanded
C</a> and <a href="https://underhandedcrypto.com/">Underhanded
Crypto</a> contests. Our goal with
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is to make it easy to write trustworthy
low-level software that is resistant to accidental security vulnerabilities.
Less often challenged has been Rust’s ability to protect against
<em>deliberate</em> vulnerabilities in the face of scrutiny. This challenge is
designed to put our language and <a href="https://crates.io/">the broader Rust
ecosystem</a> to the test, to help us learn where our blind
spots are and what needs to be done to address them. In short, we want you to
break our stuff using reasonable, easy-to-read code. Can you write 100% safe
Rust that hides a logic bug, or hide an exploit in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/unsafe.html">unsafe</a> Rust that passes an audit?
Now’s your chance!</p

        <h2>Incremental Compilation</h2>
        <h3>The Rust Programming Language Blog - September 08, 2016</h3>
        <p>I remember when, during the 1.0 anniversary presentation at the
<a href="https://air.mozilla.org/bay-area-rust-meetup-may-2016/">Bay Area Meetup</a>, Aaron Turon talked about Dropbox so far having been
pretty happy with using Rust in production there. <em>The core
team has been in touch with them regularly</em>, he said, <em>asking them, you know,
what do you need? And their answer is always: faster compiles …</em> To the
seasoned Rust user it is no surprise that this solicited a knowing chuckle from
the audience. Improving compile times has actually been a major development
focus after Rust reached 1.0 – although, up to this point, much of the work
towards this goal has gone into laying <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">architectural foundations</a> within
the compiler and we are only slowly beginning to see actual results.</p

        <h2>Shape of errors to come</h2>
        <h3>The Rust Programming Language Blog - August 10, 2016</h3>
        <p>There are changes afoot in the Rust world. If you’ve tried out the latest nightly, you’ll notice
something is <em>a little different</em>. For the past few months we’ve been working on new way of
reporting errors that’s easier to read and understand. This is part of an on-going campaign to
improve Rust’s usability across the board. We mentioned ways to help us
<a href="http://www.jonathanturner.org/2016/08/helping-out-with-rust-errors.html">make the transition</a>
to the new errors, and already many people have jumped in (and thank you to those volunteers!)</p
