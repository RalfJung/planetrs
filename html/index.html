        <h3>The Rust Programming Language Blog - February 06, 2017</h3>
        <p>Starting with 2017, Rust is following an <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1728">open roadmap process</a> for setting our
aims for the year. The process is coordinated with <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/06/30/State-of-Rust-Survey-2016.html">the survey</a> and
<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/2016-rust-commercial-user-survey-results/4317">production user outreach</a>, to make sure our goals are aligned with the needs of
Rust’s users. It culminates in a <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/setting-our-vision-for-the-2017-cycle/3958?u=aturon">community-wide discussion</a> and ultimately
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1774">an RFC</a> laying out a vision.</p>

        <h3>Piston - February 02, 2017</h3>
        <p>I just finished reading 3 papers sent to me by Stephen Salter about geoengineering
by brightening the albedo of clouds to buy us time fixing climate change.
This is so far the best approach forward that I have seen so far.</p>

        <h2>Unsafe code and shared references</h2>
        <h3>Niko Matsakis - February 01, 2017</h3>
        <p>In a previous post, I talked about a <a href="/babysteps/blog/2017/01/22/assigning-blame-to-unsafe-code/">proposed approach to drafting the
unsafe code guidelines</a>. Specifically, I want to the approach of having
an <strong>executable specification</strong> of Rust with additional checks that
will signal when undefined behavior has occurred. In this post, I want
to try to dive into that idea a bit more and give some more specifics
of the approach I have in mind. I’m going to focus on this post on the
matter of the proper use of shared references <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;T</code> – I’ll completely
ignore <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;mut T</code> for now, since those are much more complicated
(because they require a notion of uniqueness).</p>

        <h2>Setting Expectations for Rust's Difficulty</h2>
        <h3>Suspect Semantics - January 27, 2017</h3>
        <p>In this post I discuss the experiences of people coming to Rust from other languages. What their expectations generally are, how Rust meets or doesn&rsquo;t meet those expectations, and how Rust might do better both at meeting those expectations, and at helping new users to calibrate expectations appropriately.</p>

        <h2>Lowering Rust traits to logic</h2>
        <h3>Niko Matsakis - January 26, 2017</h3>
        <p>Over the last year or two (man, it’s scary how time flies), I’ve been
doing quite a lot of thinking about Rust’s trait system. I’ve been
looking for a way to correct a number of flaws and shortcomings in the
current implementation, not the least of which is that it’s
performance is not that great. But also, I’ve been wanting to get a
relatively clear, normative definition of how the trait system works,
so that we can better judge possible extensions. After a number of
false starts, I think I’m finally getting somewhere, so I wanted to
start writing about it.</p>

        <h2>A brief teaser about Composable Parallel Stream Processing with Rayon</h2>
        <h3>Piston - January 26, 2017</h3>
        <p>A few days ago, I was about to write a blog post about a programming pattern in Rust,
using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rayon">Rayon</a> library.
Then, I discovered there are some things to learn about this pattern that could lead to
other variations of it, in some ways that is more closer to the original inspiration:
<a href="https://github.com/damelang/nile">The Nile programming language</a> that I mentioned in the <a href="http://blog.piston.rs/2016/12/31/happy-new-year/">Happy New Year blog post</a>.
I figured out this requires some more time to study, but by request, here is a teaser blog post about it.</p>
