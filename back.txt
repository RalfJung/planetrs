Our goal with\n<a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a> is to make it easy to write trustworthy\nlow-level software that is resistant to accidental security vulnerabilities.\nLess often challenged has been Rust’s ability to protect against\n<em>deliberate</em> vulnerabilities in the face of scrutiny. This challenge is\ndesigned to put our language and <a href=\"https://crates.io/\">the broader Rust\necosystem</a> to the test, to help us learn where our blind\nspots are and what needs to be done to address them. In short, we want you to\nbreak our stuff using reasonable, easy-to-read code. Can you write 100% safe\nRust that hides a logic bug, or hide an exploit in\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/unsafe.html\">unsafe</a> Rust that passes an audit?\nNow’s your chance!"},{"info":{"id":"RustLang","name":"The Rust Programming Language Blog","feedurl":"https://blog.rust-lang.org/feed.xml","homepage":"https://blog.rust-lang.org"},"title":"Announcing Rust 1.12.1","date":"2016-10-20T00:00:00Z","hdate":"October 20, 2016","uid":"4a38c7df-a784-5615-b707-4d62cb78eb62","link":"http://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/10/20/Rust-1.12.1.html","resume":"The Rust team is happy to announce the latest version of Rust, 1.12.1.
